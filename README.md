# Brave Girl 

**A multi-leveling microgame I created in Unity for my niece to practice her math skills!**

## Instructions
- The goal of the game is to get as many points while defeating enemies with your brain!
- Points can be obtained by either picking up fruits and vegies, or by answering a math question correctly when you run into an enemy.

- If you answer a question correctly when running into an enemy, you will gain 5 points and the enemy will dissapear.
